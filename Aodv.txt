Program execution of last ThreeProgram:
Step1:
Go to Examples/Routing/
Copy manet-routing-compare.cc file and paste in scratch folder
Step2:
Then goto terminal
Type these commands to get CSVfiles for 1:OLSR,2-AODV,3-DSDV,4-DSR
./waf --run “scratch/manet-routing-compare --CSVfileName=OLSR --protocol=1”
The above command creates csv file for OLSR
Similarly do the same for AODV,DSDV and DSR as shown below
./waf --run “scratch/manet-routing-compare --CSVfileName=AODV --protocol=2”
ITS FOR AODV
./waf --run “scratch/manet-routing-compare --CSVfileName=DSDV --protocol=3”
ITS FOR DSDV
./waf --run “scratch/manet-routing-compare --CSVfileName=DSR --protocol=4”

Step3:
AFTER CSV FILE ARE GENERATED OPEN ALL TOGETHER AND FOLLOW STEPS AS SHOWN BELOW
1. REMOVE FIRST LINE
2. REPLACE , WITH SPACE ( )
3. SAVE ALL FILES
Step4:
Then write a GNUPLOT code as shown below by opening
gedit gnucode.plt




set terminal pdf 
set output "abhi.pdf"
set title "Recieve Rate"
set xlabel "Simulation Time (Seconds)"
set ylabel "Recieving Rate"
plot "AODV" using 1:2 with lines title "AODV_R" , "OLSR" using 1:2 with lines title "OLSR_R","DSDV" using 1:2 with lines title "DSDV_R","DSR" using 1:2 with lines  title "DSR_R"


set title "Packet "
set xlabel "Simulation Time (Seconds)"
set ylabel "Packet Recieved"
plot "AODV" using 1:3 with lines title "AODV_P" lw 2, "OLSR" using 1:3 with lines  title "OLSR_P","DSDV" using 1:3 with lines title "DSDV_P","DSR" using 1:3 with lines  title "DSR_P"


Final Step:After saving above code with .plt extension
Link to ns-3.32 in terminal and run command which is shown below
gnuplot gnucode.plt

The Output screenshots are as shown below
